# Project Title: Code and Data for Naked Mole-Rat Behavioral Study

This repository contains the data processing and analysis code for a manuscript on behavioral study in naked mole-rats. The workflow is divided into two main parts: data preprocessing using Python and statistical analysis and visualization using R. The code is intended to be run in a specific order, starting with Python scripts and followed by R scripts.

## Overview

- **Python scripts** (in `python_code/`) process the raw data and generate output files.
- **R scripts** (in `R_code/`) perform statistical analyses and generate figures based on the processed data.

---

## Environment

### Python
- Version: Tested with Python 3.10.12
  - numpy
  - pandas
- Install with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas

### R
- Version: Tested with R 4.2.3
- Install required packages by running the following in R:

```R
source("install_packages.R")
```

---

## Execution Workflow

1. Run the Python scripts in the `python_code/` folder in order.
   - These scripts read raw data from `data/event_data/` and output processed data to `data/processed_data/`.

2. Run the Rmd scripts in the `R_code/` folder in order.
   - These scripts read data from `data/pre_info_data/` and `data/processed_data/` and output processed data to `data/processed_data/`.
   - Figures will be saved in the `data/Figure/` folder.

---

## Data Organization Note

- The R scripts assume that **all processed data are stored under `data/processed_data/`**, organized first by data type, and then by colony.
- For example, each type of data (e.g., `table_data_with_nan_filled_by_nest/`, `room_def_with_nan/`) has its own subfolder, and within each of these, there should be subfolders for each colony (`2B/`, `2D/`, `HG/`, `HT/`, `LOC/`).
